<!-- What you need -->

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>2 to 3 tablespoons shredded cheese</li>
<li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1/4 to 1/2 cup filling</li>
</ul>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<li>Mixing bowl</li>
<li>Whisk</li>
<li>8-inch nonstick skillet</li>
<li>Spatula</li>
<li>Dinner plate</li><h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Whisk the eggs:</b> Crack both eggs into a mixing bowl. Whisk the eggs until completely combined, and season with salt and pepper. If you're adding cheese or other fillings, make sure they are prepped and nearby.</li>
<li><b>Warm the skillet and melt the butter: </b>Place an 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat and melt the butter. Tilt the skillet as the butter melts to evenly coat the bottom. When the butter stops sizzling, the pan is heated and ready.</li>
<li><b>Pour the eggs into the skillet: </b>Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet. Immediately tilt the pan so the eggs coat the entire bottom. The eggs should sizzle on contact; if not, continue cooking, but remember to heat the pan a little longer next time.</li>
<li><b>Drag and push the eggs to form waves:</b> Use a spatula to gently drag and push the cooked eggs from the edges toward the center of the pan, making space for the uncooked eggs and forming waves in the omelette. Tilt the skillet so that the uncooked eggs flow into the open spaces.</li>
<li><b>Cook the omelette for 1 to 2 minutes: </b>The omelette will finish cooking in 1 to 2 minutes. When done, the bottom will be set and the edges will look crisp. The top of the omelette should still look fairly wet and uncooked, but there will no longer be any loose, easily flowing liquid egg ? the omelette will continue cooking off the heat, so finish when you think the top still seems a bit underdone.</li>
<li><b>Top with cheese and fillings:</b> If using, sprinkle the cheese and fillings down the center of the omelette.</li>
<li><b>Fold the omelette:</b> Fold the bottom third of the omelette over the center, and then fold the top third down. Alternatively, fold the omelette in half.</li>
<li><b>Slide the omelette onto a plate:</b> Gently slide the omelette onto a plate. Eat right away while still hot.</li>
</ol>
